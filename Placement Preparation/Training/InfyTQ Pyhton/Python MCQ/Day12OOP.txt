A. 2 and 1
B. 3 and 3
C. 3 and 1
D. 3 and 2

4. What will be the output of below Python code?

class Student:

	def __init__(self,name,id):

		self.name=name

		self.id=id

		print(self.id)

std=Student("Simon",1)

std.id=2

print(std.id)

A. 1
   1
B. 1
   2
C. 2
   1
D. 2
   2
View Answer

Ans : B
Explanation: When object with id =1 is created for Student, constructor is invoked and it prints 1. Later, id has been changed to 2, so next print statement prints 2.
5. What will be the output of below Python code?

class A():

	def __init__(self,count=100):

		self.count=count



obj1=A()

obj2=A(102)

print(obj2.count)

A. 100
   100
B. 100
   102
C. 102
   102
D. Error
View Answer

Ans : B
Explanation: By default,the value of "count" is 100, so obj1.count=100. For second object, value of "count" is 102, so obj2.count=102.

class A:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name=name

B. id(a1) and id(a2) will have different values.
C. Two objects with same value of attribute cannot be created.

View Answer

Ans : B

7. Which of the following is correct?

	def __init__(self):

		self.count=5

		self.count=count+1

a=A()

a=A(5)

print(a.num)

a.change()

print(a.num)

A. 5
   7
B. 5
   5
C. 3
   3
D. 3
   7
